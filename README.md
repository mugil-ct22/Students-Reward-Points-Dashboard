üöÄ Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

1. Prerequisites
Node.js installed on your machine.

[suspicious link removed] and a client like MySQL Workbench installed.

2. Database Setup
Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your local MySQL server.

Create the database by running the following command:

SQL

CREATE DATABASE student_rewards;
Run the entire database.sql script provided with this project. This will create all the necessary tables and insert sample data for two users.

3. Backend Setup
Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root folder.

Install the necessary npm packages:

Bash

npm install
Create a new file in the root folder named .env.

Add your MySQL database credentials to the .env file. (Replace 'your_mysql_password' with your actual password).

Code snippet

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD='your_mysql_password'
DB_DATABASE=student_rewards
Start the backend server:

Bash

node server.js
The server should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

4. Frontend Setup
The easiest way to run the frontend is with the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code.

Right-click the index.html file and select "Open with Live Server".

Your browser will open to the login page, typically at a URL like http://127.0.0.1:5500.
